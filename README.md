# liquibase-disable-analytics
This extension will disable analytics on any Liquibase installation.

Analytics can also be disabled by supplying the following parameter: `--analytics-enabled=false`. However, this will not apply to automated tests, so this extension primarily exists to be used as a test dependency for the Liquibase extensions.
